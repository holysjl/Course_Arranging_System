# Course_Arranging_System
- This system based on a Graphic Library YAGE which was developed by one team from BUPT and has not been published online.
- The core code is in "schedule.cpp" which contains functions about how to schedule courses for different class based on the following information:
 Â - teachers' available time and courses
  - classroom's size
  - classes' courses and number of people
